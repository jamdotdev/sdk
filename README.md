### Jam.dev SDK

1-line SDK for incorporating custom data such as app state and user ID in bug reports captured with Jam.

Check out the [docs](https://jam.dev/docs/product-features/dev-tools/jam.metadata) to get started.

For a full code example of how to integrate the Jam SDK into your web app, see the `docs` folder in this repo, and its accompanying [live site](https://jamdotdev.github.io/sdk/).

### Feedback

Our goal is to help you debug faster, without having to go back-and-forth to clarify bugs or gather more info. Reach out to the Jam team at hello@jam.dev with feature requests and feedback. The Jam founders are cc'ed there, and would love to hear from you (even just to share what you're building with Jam!).
